title: Pioneering beyond Formula 1
---

Formula 1 is just one area of the UK’s thriving motorsport industry. The country is also home to Formula E, the new global electric racing series, and is a major international supplier to IndyCar and NASCAR in the USA, the China Touring Car Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans series.

Some of the world’s largest motorsport manufacturers can be found in the Motorsport Valley. Cosworth, based in Northampton, is a global leader in engine electronics and telemetry, Berkshire’s Xtrac is world-renowned for the design and manufacture of transmission systems, while Wirth Research is a leading supplier of vehicle simulation technology both to global motorsports series and high technology companies across automotive, aerospace and defence.
