title: Making the most of a connected network

The domestic content of UK-made cars has increased from 36% to 41% since 2013 and continues to rise. With so many options in the supply chain, OEMs are looking to reduce their transportation and logistics costs by choosing local suppliers.
 
The renowned ‘Midlands Engine’ is a hub of OEM factories, R&D centres and company HQs in the heart of England. Major automotive manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover, BMW and MG Motors call it home, whilst a pioneering [Drive West Midland](http://www.drivewestmidlands.co.uk/) programme promotes further competitiveness in the supply chain.
 
Just north of the Midlands Engine, the ‘Northern Powerhouse’ is one of the strongest areas of manufacturing strength in the UK. Not only is the region home to Nissan, General Motors and VW (Bentley), it also hosts the [Northern Automotive Alliance](http://northernautoalliance.com/) and the [North East Automotive Alliance](https://www.northeastautomotivealliance.com/). Both organisations provide support to companies setting up in the region, as well as to the industry at large.

With such a committed automotive community already established, there are countless supply chain opportunities on offer.
