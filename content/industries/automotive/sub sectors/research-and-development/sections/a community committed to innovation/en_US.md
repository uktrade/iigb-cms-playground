title: A community committed to innovation
---

Cutting-edge automotive manufacturers like Mercedes Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and Bentley, as well as 9 out of the 11 Formula 1 teams, know the strength of our facilities and people.  

Our appetite for innovation has already attracted global talent. Even proud foreign manufacturers, like German juggernaut Mercedes, recognise our expertise in automotive R&D and have opened centres here. The result is a collaborative community that strives to push the boundaries of what’s possible in automotive.

[Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk), the government funded innovation agency, has a special interest in automotive advancements and offers significant funding to enable important R&D in the sector. In July 2016, they offered businesses £2.3 million for low carbon development and demonstration projects in this niche vehicle sector.

But it doesn’t stop there. Once a business has made their big breakthrough, we can help them to get to the next stage. [Catapult](https://www.catapult.org.uk/) research centres help new and emerging technologies into market through a combination of public and private sector funding. Last year, the government supported Catapults with over £250 million.
