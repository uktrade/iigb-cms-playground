title: A centre of excellence in low carbon production
---

Low carbon initiatives are not just a great opportunity for the automotive sector; they’re also vital to our global future. We have made a commitment to position the UK as a centre of excellence for low carbon production. 

As a result we formed the [Advanced Propulsion Centre](http://www.apcuk.co.uk/) in 2013 in partnership with the Automotive Council. Both parties have committed to £500 million each over the next 10 years. Their collaborative projects range from revolutionising battery packs to developing heavily downsized, fuel-efficient petrol engines for electric cars.

Automotive giants, including Ford, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, are also developing low carbon technologies in their UK R&D centres. As a result, we are now the largest EU manufacturer of electric vehicles and has the largest EU market for electric vehicles (25% and 20% of market share respectively).
