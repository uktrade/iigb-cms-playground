title: Strong government support and fair regulation
---

The UK's regulatory system is effective, fair and flexible. The globally respected Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), supports the industry and ensures transparency.

A survey of finance professionals found our regulatory environment to be the most open to foreign business of all the world’s major financial centres.

The UK government is fully committed to the success and expansion of financial services in the UK. The UK’s Corporation tax is lowest in the G20 at 20%, and will reduce to 18% by 2020.

A wide range of grant funding and other support is available to help you establish your business in the UK and expand into overseas markets.
