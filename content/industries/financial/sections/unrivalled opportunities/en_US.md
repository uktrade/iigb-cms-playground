title: Unrivalled opportunities

The UK's international influence creates opportunities that others cannot match. Its Islamic finance sector:

-	was the first country outside the Islamic world to issue an Islamic bond 
-	has more than 20 banks offering Islamic financial services, nearly double the number in the US 
-	has over 100,000 Islamic finance retail customers in the UK

London is established as the Western hub for offshore renminbi (RMB) trading, with flow of RMB funds expected to increase rapidly. Almost two-thirds of all RMB payments outside China and Hong Kong now take place in the UK.

The UK is also a market leader in:

-	trading-related activity – in particular foreign exchange and over the counter (OTC) derivatives
-	asset management – a sector second only in size to the US, accounting for 36% of European assets under management
-	insurance provision – accounting for 7% of worldwide premium
