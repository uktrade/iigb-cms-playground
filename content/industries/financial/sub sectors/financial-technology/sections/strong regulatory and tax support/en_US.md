title: Strong regulatory and tax support
---

 
The UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), supports the industry, ensuring transparency within the market.  While it helps to maintain market stability, the FCA supports disruptive technologies, and has stated it is sympathetic to companies developing new business models outside of current regulation.

A number of tax incentives are also provided by the UK Government to encourage innovation. They include:

-	the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)
-	the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS)
-	Entrepreneursâ€™ Relief (ER)
-	R&D tax credits
-   the Patent Box scheme - companies pay a lower rate of Corporation Tax on profits earned from their patented innovations
