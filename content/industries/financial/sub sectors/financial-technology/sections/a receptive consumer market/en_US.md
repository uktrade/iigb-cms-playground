title: A receptive consumer market
---

UK consumers are sophisticated early adopters, and are open to new, innovative models of service delivery. Willingness to switch providers has greatly increased, backed by UK government measures to make the switching process easier.

Examples of this receptivity include:

-	financial aggregators - around a third of the UK population now use them to choose their car insurance
-	e-commerce - consumers spend much more on e-commerce than their equivalents in Germany, France and the USA
-	peer-to-peer lending - the UK has been one of the fastest adopters, with the market growing at 250% annually between 2012 and 2014
