The UK government has demonstrated a strong commitment to the sector - its ambition is for the UK to lead the world in investment management. 

The government's UK Investment Management Strategy (2013) focuses on:

-	improving the UK's taxation regime
-	improving the regulatory environment 
-	representing the UK globally through effective marketing

Since the strategy launch, fund authorisation times have been reduced by around 50% and the tax environment is more favourable for fund management and as a funds domicile.
