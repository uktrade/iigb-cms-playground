The economic picture for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is one of stability and long term growth.  The UK’s creative industries grew by 8.9% in 2014 - almost double the UK economy as a whole (source: DCMS).

Britain is a gateway to the export markets of Europe and the world.  Its creative sector is particularly export-focused. 

The sector:

-	exported £19.8 billion of creative services in 2014, 9% of all UK service exports (source: DCMS)
-	attracts significant creative investment, making a major contribution to the UK’s position as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe.
-	attracted 486 inward investment projects in 2014-15, in combination with the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) sector
