---

The UK is Europe’s largest mobile content market, with over £1 billion spent on mobile applications, content and services each year, and the highest mobile advertising spend per head. Mobile in the UK has been boosted by:

- an increase in smartphones and choice of mobile contracts
- a strong games and advertising industry
- an enhanced mobile network infrastructure

Other growth opportunities include:

- social media – Britons are amongst the biggest users of social networks in Europe
- digital radio and TV – the UK has one of the world’s largest digital radio networks, and 97% of UK homes have digital TV
- innovative tech in production and art – for example sensors and motion capture in film
- digital music – accounting for 54% of all music consumption in 2015

The UK’s strengths have ensured investment by some of the world’s biggest digital players – Google, Facebook and Amazon have all opened research and development (R&D) hubs in the UK.
