---

The UK has easy access to Europe and the rest of the world. It has a large research community and an ecosystem of partners, academic institutions and skilled workers. These networks mean smaller companies can easily work with each other, and with major firms. The sector:

- saw Gross Value Added (GVA) of all digital tech in the UK grow by 27% between 2010 and 2014, with GVA for 2014 reaching £87 billion
- accounted for 46% of all exports from the UK creative industries in 2012
- operates in an advanced consumer market – the British are the world’s biggest online spenders

95 percent of UK homes and businesses will have access to superfast broadband by 2017. Current coverage is already higher than France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A 2015 World Economic Forum report cites the UK as one of the best environments in the world for ICT development.
