The UK Government is fully committed to support the UK’s status as a leading digital nation. Measures to complement its low level of corporation tax, dropping to 18% by 2020, include:

- investment of more than £200 million in a network of Technology and Innovation Centres supporting the commercialisation of new technologies by business
- tax incentives to encourage innovation, such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, R&D tax credits and the Patent Box Scheme, which lowers corporation tax on patented invention profits still further

The UK offers a number of world-class digital start-up programmes and opportunities for angel investment.
