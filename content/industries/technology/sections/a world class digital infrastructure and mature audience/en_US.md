We have the strongest and most embedded digital audience in Europe. British consumers are tech-savvy early adopters with a huge appetite for new digital services.  

We lead the EU’s five biggest economies on most measures of coverage, such as take up, usage and choice for both mobile and fixed broadband.

In the UK:

- the internet is widespread, where 85% of adults have internet access
- in 2015, 86% of households (22.5 million) had internet access that’s up from 57% in 2006
- access to the internet using a mobile phone more than doubled between 2010 and 2015 - that’s up from 24% to 61%
- in 2014, 66% of adults owned a smartphone - that's a 4% increase on 2013 and a 26% increase on 2010
- adult mobile users now spend almost twice as long online with their smartphones than on laptops and personal computers
- mobile broadband connections are the fastest in the world
digital TV services launched in 1998, the first in the world
97% of homes have digital TV

This creates a market environment that unlocks new commercial possibilities and encourages innovation in new content, services and applications.
