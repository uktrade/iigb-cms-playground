title: We support the growth and development of entrepreneurs
---

Our tech scene is currently experiencing rapid growth and expansion, helped by the mature environment that supports early stage companies and entrepreneurs.

Our support currently includes:

- the most active venture capital market outside of the US
- a vibrant business angel community
- more than 30 well-established accelerator programmes across the country
- a strong network of business mentors

Valuations of early-stage companies have increased steadily due to initiatives such as DIT’s Global Entrepreneurs Programme (supporting inward investor entrepreneurs) and TechCityUK’s Future Fifty Programme (accelerates the growth of high-potential digital SMEs).
 
GP Bullhound, the tech-focused investment bank, reports that 17 of the 40 unicorn companies (tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion) in Europe are from here.
