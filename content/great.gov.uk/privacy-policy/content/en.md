Not all of this information will be personal data, and the extent to which any of this information is personal data may depend on applicable data protection laws.

Some of this information will be collected through the use of cookies and other related tracking technologies.  Cookies are used to distinguish you from other users of this website. DIT provides details on what cookies do and a full list of cookies that DIT uses on its websites. For more information see our cookie policy.

DIT may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites the DIT operates or services DIT provides. DIT also works with third parties (for example, partners and subcontractors) and may receive information about you from these third parties.  You should refer to the privacy policies of those third parties if you have concerns about their disclosure of your personal information to us.

## How the DIT protects your personal information

The DIT complies with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

The DIT will:
* tell you why the information is needed. For example, we ask about your company’s exporting experience to decide whether it is suitable for inclusion in the Find a Buyer service.
* only ask for what’s needed
* make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t
* tell you if the information is shared with other organisations and if you can say no to this
* only keep the information for as long as it’s needed
* not make it available for commercial use (for example, for marketing) without your permission

You must:
* give accurate information
* tell the DIT about any changes, for example, to your address

## Sharing your information

Your information can be shared with other teams in the DIT or other organisations where this is needed to process your application.

There are some cases when your information can be shared for other reasons, for example, to prevent crime. 

If you’re asking for information that isn’t published on www.GREAT.gov.uk, DIT may need to contact other organisations to find answers to your questions.

If your question is technical, DIT may need to pass information to technology suppliers. DIT will only pass on personal data if it is necessary to do so, and will not keep your personal data or records of its correspondence longer than necessary.

## The DIT staff handling your information

The DIT staff are trained in handling information and understand how important it is to protect personal and other sensitive information.
Within DIT, access to your personal information is limited to those members of our team who need access to it in order to provide you with our services which you request; to communicate with you (including, with your consent,  to send you marketing communications); and to carry out legal or regulatory obligations.

* ask to receive a copy of the personal information the DIT holds about you
* amend inaccurate personal information
* stop us sending you direct marketing communications
