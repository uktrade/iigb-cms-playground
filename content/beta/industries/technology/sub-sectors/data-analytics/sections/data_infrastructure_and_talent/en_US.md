title: The data infrastructure and talent to succeed
---

Having such an advanced data sector means we have the infrastructure and skills to meet rising demand.


A well-developed data centre and cloud computing infrastructure sets the UK ahead of the competition. The UK is already the largest data centre market in Europe with over 26% of the capacity for the region.


It’s estimated that 31,000 people work in specialist big data roles in the UK and the talent pipeline, together with demand, should see that increase by 243% over the next 5 years. 


Universities such as Goldsmiths, Edinburgh and Sheffield offer degrees in big data analytics, with others offering courses in data science, artificial intelligence and visualisation. Oxford, Cambridge, University College London (UCL), Warwick and Edinburgh, 3 of whom are among the top 6 universities in the world, have launched the UK’s national centre of expertise for data science, The Alan Turing Institute.


With such an extensive talent pool there is plenty of opportunity for companies to hire the staff they need for growth.
