### Creative disruption is driving digital advertising

The size of the UK digital advertising market was 7.2 billion GBP in 2014. Mobile advertising increased to 1.6 billion GBP; that's up 63% on the previous year. 

Delivering targeted and effective advertising has also generated new business segments which are thriving here. That means many new opportunities for market entrants in areas such as programmatic trading, native advertising and analytics.

### Personalisation is boosting mobile

The UK is Europe’s largest mobile content market, with over 1 billion GBP spent on mobile applications, content and services each year.  It also has the highest mobile advertising spend per head. Our e-commerce market was worth 104 billion GBP in 2014. 

Mobile in the UK has been boosted by our strong leadership in personalisation of platforms and content, an increase in smartphones and choice of mobile contracts, and a strong games and advertising industry. This is all supported by an enhanced mobile network infrastructure.

More mobile advertising networks are setting up in the UK, providing greater options to generate revenue from content.
