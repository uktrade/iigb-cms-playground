The UK is home to the worldâ€™s biggest online spenders. We're a nation of established internet users and early adopters, with over 64% of households having 3 or more internet enabled devices. By 2017, 95% of UK homes and businesses will have access to superfast broadband. Current coverage is already higher than France, Germany, Italy and Spain. 

The sector saw Gross Value Added (GVA) of all digital tech in the UK grow by 27% between 2010 and 2014, with GVA for 2014 reaching 87 billion GBP.

A 2015 World Economic Forum report cites the UK as one of the best environments in the world for informations and communications technology (ICT) development.
