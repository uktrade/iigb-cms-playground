Recruitment of new talent with fresh ideas and technical knowhow is easier in the UK. For example, over three-quarters of our games workforce holds an undergraduate degree, and there’s a higher proportion of postgraduate degrees than anywhere else in the world. 

Creative companies employ over 1.9 million people, and as a content producer and distributor based here you’ll be able to select from a pool of over 100,000 creative subject graduates per year.

A strong commitment to research and development in the UK across all content production areas helps us adopt new technologies first and stay ahead of the competition.
