The UK is the number one destination for health and life sciences foreign direct investment in Europe.

That’s because the fundamentals are strong: a tax structure that rewards innovation, a world class science base and a track record of life sciences excellence. You’ll find the people and facilities to develop your ideas here – from inception to clinical trials. We have a world-renowned research, test bed and delivery partner in our National Health Service (NHS).

There are already over 5,600 life sciences companies operating in the UK, generating a turnover of over 60 billion GBP and more than 30 billion GBP in exports. These companies span the life sciences product development, supply and services chain, and employ more than 220,000 people.

The UK is a global life sciences supercluster with concentrations of expertise from the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge to Northern Ireland. Inward investors can rely on a well-developed and publicly-funded infrastructure for experimental medicine and clinical trials. A recent KPMG report states we have the strongest biomedical pipeline in Europe.

Our research credentials are strong - the UK has 4 of the world’s top 10 universities. Research benefits from our great industry partnerships, significant funding from the government’s research councils, and charities like the Wellcome Trust.

There’s a pragmatic and supportive regulatory regime, and strong government support. In addition to the NHS, the UK has the deep expertise and international leadership of the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and a world regarded health technology assessment body in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
