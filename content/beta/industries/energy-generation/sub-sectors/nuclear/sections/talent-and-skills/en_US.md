More than 65,000 people are currently working in the UKâ€™s civil nuclear industry. These are skilled workers with experience in fuel manufacturing, the operation and maintenance of reactors, and management of the waste generated from the operations.

Nuclear expertise is well distributed across the nation, but there are specific cluster areas where many major businesses share research, development and thinking. These include: 

- north west England, where [Sellafield](http://www.sellafieldsites.com/) remains the major centre for the maintenance of nuclear skills
- south west England, where EDF Energy has established a base and Horizon Nuclear Power has begun deployment
- Yorkshire and the Humber, where growth is occurring around Sheffield, which is home to the[ Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre](http://www.amrc.co.uk/)
