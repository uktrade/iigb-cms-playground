We’re committed to delivering new and replacement energy supplies that can provide secure, reliable, low carbon electricity. Nuclear power sits at the heart of these plans. 

Nuclear energy has operated reliably and safely in the UK for over 60 years. We have extensive experience of the full nuclear life cycle, from front-end design through to decommissioning. Today, our 8 existing nuclear power plants generate around 20% of the UK’s electricity demand.
