There are government and privately backed initiatives in place to help develop further skills and knowledge in the UK’s nuclear sector. The [National College for Nuclear](https://www.nsan.co.uk/news/national-nuclear-college) works closely with the industry on a world-class curriculum that delivers high-level technical training and development. 


Degree apprenticeships, focused on nuclear engineering, provide the next generation with higher education and work based skills and experience. 


Additionally, companies operating here benefit from the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Centre’s [Fit for Nuclear](http://namrc.co.uk/services/f4n/) This is a unique assessment service which supports manufacturing companies in measuring their operations against the standards required to supply to the nuclear industry. 

The government also has up to 50 billion GBP available to support finance and insurance for   supplies from within the UK to buyers outside the UK. This support takes the form of guarantees, insurance and loans issued by its export credit agency, UK Export Finance.
