title: Investment opportunities that promote change
---
You’ll find the UK market an exciting and challenging one, with plenty of opportunities for dynamic, innovative companies.


We’re tackling climate change by moving towards a low-carbon future. The networks of the future will have to be different to the ones that have served the UK in the past.
 
Increases in electricity demand and the increasing decarbonisation of power generation, are estimated to require 100 billion GBP of capital investment in infrastructure. 


The electricity network is evolving to accommodate new types and location of electricity generation. There are 3 transmission network operators (TNO) and 6 distribution network operators (DNO) in their market. The mix of new smart energy products and services and conventional maintenance of existing network integrity makes this an exciting and dynamic market.
 
The distribution network is most likely to undergo the biggest change in the coming years and the DNOs are seeking new suppliers to increase customer-focused performance benefits. Rising interest in community energy schemes is also creating a new movement in the market for network products and services.
 
There’s also an increasing requirement for smart technologies. UK customers are early adopters of smart tech-focused energy solutions.
