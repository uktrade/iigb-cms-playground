UK-based businesses act as major suppliers to teams competing in everything from NASCAR to Formula E to the China Touring Car Championship. Famously, 7 out of 11 Formula 1 racing teams have their headquarters in the UK.

Firms that supply motorsports operate throughout the UK. The largest concentration of motorsport firms are located in 'Motorsport Valley®', a world-renowned business cluster in the south east of England with Oxford at its centre. Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor and founder of Monitor Deloitte, has described it as, “A mature economic business cluster, which is number one in the world…the jewel in the crown of British engineering.” 
In the 50 years since the modern Formula 1 era began in 1967, only 2 teams have won the Constructors Championship with a car designed outside the UK and one of those used a British engine. 

The Formula One teams with headquarters here are: 

- Red Bull Racing in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire
- McLaren Honda in Woking, Surrey
- Mercedes AMG Petronas in Brackley, Northamptonshire
- Renault Sport in Enstone, Oxfordshire
- Williams Martini Racing in Grove, Oxfordshire
- Force India in Silverstone, Northamptonshire
- Manor Racing in Banbury, Oxfordshire

Formula 1 research and development centres here are:

- Haas in Banbury, Oxfordshire
- Toro Rosso in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire

### From race to road

The UK has made more motorsport innovations in the last 60 years than any other country. Many have found their way onto road cars. These include:


- 1950s, disc brakes produced by Jaguar
- 1960s, 4 valves per cylinder engines produced by Cosworth
- 1970s, ground-effect aerodynamics produced by Lotus
- 1980s, composites produced by McLaren
- 1990s, active chassis with traction control and driver aids produced by Williams
- 2000s, Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems produced by Williams

### Pioneering technology beyond Formula 1

The UK provides a base for the new global electric racing series Formula E. It is a major supplier to IndyCar and NASCAR in the USA, the China Touring Car Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans series. 

These racing series benefit from new technology developed by UK companies. Cosworth, based in Northampton, is a global leader in engine electronics and telemetry (and now supplies data logging and telemetry for the road-going Chevrolet Corvette). While Berkshire’s Xtrac is world-renowned for the design and manufacture of transmission systems. 

UK motorsport companies are also going beyond racing into sectors such as energy storage, marine and defence. Williams Advanced Engineering has installed flywheel energy storage technology in two remote Scottish island communities. And Wildcat Automotive has transformed its Wildcat 500DKR off-road racer into a specialist military all-terrain vehicle.

Some are even going beyond physical engineering. McLaren has applied pit-stop techniques to reduce waiting times and increase operating theatre efficiency at Great Ormond Street Hospital.
