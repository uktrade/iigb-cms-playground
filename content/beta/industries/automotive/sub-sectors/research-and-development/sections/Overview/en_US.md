title: Government-backed innovation
---
In 2009, the UK government and the UK automotive industry set up a partnership called the [Automotive Council](http://www.automotivecouncil.co.uk/), to chart the renaissance of the UK auto sector. This is now seen internationally as the gold standard for government and industry cooperation, and has led to a huge expansion of both car manufacturing and automotive research and development (R&D) in the UK.


### Facilitating innovation


The capability of UK automotive R&D is demonstrated by the fact that 7 of the 11 Formula One teams have their headquarters in the UK. Formula One depends on the ability of British teams and their 4,500 UK motorsport suppliers to develop world-beating solutions.


While the ability of our engineers to develop revolutionary solutions has never been in doubt, the major change over recent years is the establishment of a comprehensive infrastructure to take concepts from laboratory to production.


[Innovate UK,](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) the UK innovation agency, supports the development of concepts to prototypes (Technology Readiness Level, or TRL 3 to 5). While the network of manufacturing Catapults helps transforms prototypes to production-ready products (TRL 5 to 8).
