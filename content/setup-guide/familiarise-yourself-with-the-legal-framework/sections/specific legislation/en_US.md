<p>1. Procurement procedure</p>
    
The UK prides itself on an open and fair procedure when selling your products and services. You can access a range of [searches to help you find public sector procurement opportunities](https://www.gov.uk/tendering-for-public-sector-contracts/overview) through the government website. Contracts Finder in England, Public Contracts Scotland, Sell2Wales and eSourcing NI provide contracting and subcontracting opportunities in their respective countries.
    
All bids to provide goods/services in the UK are subject to the Information Act 2000, which means that you can request details of the bidding process and feedback if your bid is unsuccessful. Under the Freedom of Information Act, information from your bid can be disclosed to anyone who asks for it – unless you have a non‐disclosure agreement in place. 
    
For any questions about procurement rules and procedures, contact the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). 
    
<p>2. Intellectual property</p>
    
In order to protect innovation and prosperity in business, the UK has very strict intellectual property laws. These laws protect the names, ideas, products, designs and written word of businesses. Copyright (protection of any writing, films, art, TV, music, and web content) and design right (protection of the shapes of objects) are automatically applied to your business. You do not need to do anything to apply for these.
    
Additionally, there are several ways to protect specific elements of your intellectual property in the UK, including:  
    
- trademarks. These protect names, logos and even jingles
- patents. These cover inventions and products
- registered design. These protect packaging, design, colours and appearance
    
These protections can take anywhere between 1 month and 5 years to apply for, [so check guidelines on the gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/intellectual-property-an-overview/protect-your-intellectual-property). You can also engage an intellectual property specialist (like a patent attorney) to ensure you are properly protected. 
    
<p>3. Data protection</p>
    
In the UK, our privacy and data protection laws ensure that customer data is processed, held and disposed of fairly, legally, accurately and securely. Your business must abide by the Data Protection Act, which states that customer data must be: 
    
- used fairly and lawfully
- used for limited, specifically stated purposes
- used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
- accurate
- kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary handled according to people’s data protection rights
- kept safe and secure
- not transferred outside the EEA without adequate protection
    
Stronger legal protections are in place for sensitive information like ethnic background, political or religious belief, health records and criminal records.
