title: Register your company
---

To create a private limited company, you simply [register your business with Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/register-as-an-overseas-company) within one month of beginning UK operations. The process can be completed online or by post, and involves just one form and processing fee. Online applications usually take 24 hours and cost £15, whilst postal applications can take 8‐10 days and cost £40.

If it’s your first time registering a UK company, you will also need to send your constitutional documents and accounts to Companies House, along with your application. You must notify Companies House of any amends to your company name, address, activities, directors or constitution within 21 days of the change.
