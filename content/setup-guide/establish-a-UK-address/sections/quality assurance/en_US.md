[Her Majesty’s Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) provides the assurances you need if you invest in property in England and Wales. It has over 150 years’ experience in registering land and property, managing over 24 million titles. 

At the heart of the UK planning system is the [National Planning Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/6077/2116950.pdf). This gives a clear steer on the sort of developments likely to be approved, allowing for faster decision making and less risk on money wasted on unsuccessful submissions.
