For businesses looking to build, extend or change the use of premises, the UK offers a simple planning process and has one of Europe’s most efficient procedures for obtaining construction permits. 

Nearly 90% of planning applications are granted by local planning authorities, with 75% done so within the first 3 months. To avoid risk and increase certainty, investors should choose sites with existing planning permission, Enterprise Zones with simplified planning or Local Plan allocations (known as zoning).

If you are looking to rent or lease premises in the UK, there are standard leasing practices based upon UK land law to be aware of. Find out more information by speaking to a Relocation Specialist from our UK Advisory Network.  

If you do not want to commit to a long-term lease, then a serviced office could be a good option. Prices vary depending on where you set up in the UK, with the average price for a desk in central London ranging between £500-£600 per month.
