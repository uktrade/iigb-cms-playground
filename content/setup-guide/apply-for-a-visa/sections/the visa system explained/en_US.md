The UK visa system is split into tiers, which are then divided into sub‐tiers. As a business launching in the UK, tiers one, two and five could be relevant to you. 

**Tier One** is aimed at individuals who will contribute to the UK’s productivity and growth – this includes entrepreneurs, investors and graduate entrepreneurs.

**Tier Two** allows employers to sponsor skilled migrants in order to fill job roles in the UK.

**Tier Five** helps businesses employ workers on a temporary basis in the UK.
