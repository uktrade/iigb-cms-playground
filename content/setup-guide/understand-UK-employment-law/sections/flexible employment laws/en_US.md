The UK’s simple and flexible employment laws protect and promote the interests of employees while making it easy for businesses to hire and manage the right people with the right skills as and when they need them. 

Specific employment laws cover minimum entitlements to pay, leave and working conditions. Employers also have statutory responsibilities to ensure that its employees have a right to work in the UK.

The range of flexible contract options for UK businesses include full time fixed term, part time open permanent, agency, zero‐hours, freelancer and contractor contracts, allowing businesses to make the right hires to suit their needs.
