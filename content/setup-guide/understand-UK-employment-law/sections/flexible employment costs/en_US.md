The UK operates a **National Minimum Wage** in order to encourage people to work and prevent businesses from using low wages to compete unfairly. This is accompanied by a **National Living Wage**, which applies to all those aged 25 and over to give people the opportunity to better provide for themselves and their families.

Find out more about the UKâ€™s employment laws by contacting your [local DIT advisor](https://www.contactus.ukti.gov.uk/enquiry/topic).
