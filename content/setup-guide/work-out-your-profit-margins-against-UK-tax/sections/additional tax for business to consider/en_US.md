title: Additional tax for businesses to consider
---

For businesses that buy and sell goods and services, there are two main taxes to be aware of. 

*Value Added Tax*

VAT applies to all goods and services across all EU countries at a rate of 20%.

*Import and export tax*

The UK is still a member of the EU, so continues to operate under the Free Trade Agreements in place – that means there are no duties to pay. [Duties and regulations vary amongst non‐EU countries, you can find out more about them from HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/import-export).
