Because the UK is committed to helping businesses succeed, there are numerous tax relief schemes and incentives for owners and investors alike. 

*Tax relief for investing in SMEs*

The UK offers an attractive venture capital scheme to help SMEs expand. The [Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-enterprise-investment-scheme-introduction) and the [Venture Capital Trust (VCT)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/venture-capital-trusts-statistics) are two schemes that have been extended to offer tax relief for individuals interested in investing in small businesses.

*Tax incentives for innovation*

Research and development (R&D) tax credits are available to promote fast‚Äêgrowing, innovative services and products. The [Patent Box](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-the-patent-box) offers a 10% corporation tax on profits from inventions patented in the UK (compared to the usual 20% corporation tax).
