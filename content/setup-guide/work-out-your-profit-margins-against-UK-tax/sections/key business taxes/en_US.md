In order to keep driving business forward, [the UK has a transparent and principled tax system](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/why-overseas-companies-should-set-up-in-the-uk/why-overseas-companies-should-set-up-in-the-uk#tax-in-the-uk). Taxes for businesses include:

*Corporation tax*

The current rate is 20%, with plans to reduce this to 15% by 2020. That’s the lowest in the G7 and joint lowest in the G20.

*National insurance*

The UK’s employer social security contribution rate is 13.8% on employee earnings over £153 per week. 

*Pension contributions*

Employees are automatically enrolled into [Workplace Pensions](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/about-workplace-pensions). You can choose to set up your own pension scheme or you can enrol your employees into an established scheme, like the [National Employments Savings Trust (NEST) which will handle the process automatically](http://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/NestWeb/public/employers/contents/what-employers-need-to-do.html).
